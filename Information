g_ambush 1                (ambush mod 1 = on, 0 = off)

g_ambush_dretch_s2 20     (number of dretch kills to stage 3.)
g_ambush_basilisk_s3 20   (number of basilisk kills to stage 4.)

g_ambush_tyrants_to_win   (number of tyrant kills to "NO EGGS" message.)
g_ambush_dodge 50         (how much aliens dodging left and right)
g_ambush_dodge_random 10  (how big random number will be added to dodge)

g_ambush_sec_to_start 40  (warmup for aliens)
g_ambush_stage_suicide 0  (when you got new stage, all remaining aliens immediately die. 1 = on (easy), 0 = off (hard).)
g_ambush_no_egg_ffoff 1   (when your server using friendly fire, then will be turned off for aliens in last stage with no eggs. Otherwise rest of tyrants will kill each other and for humans remain only last one. After humans win, friendly fire wil be restored. If you play alone or only few players, I recommend set it to 0 and leave friendly fire on, because othervise tyrants probably kill you and without credits can't win or kill tyrant. 1 = on (hard), 0 = off (easy).)
g_ambush_kill_spawns 0    (if you leave it to 0, then humans can't destroy eggs and they must finish game with tyrants together)
g_ambush_att_buildables 0 (0 mean aliens attacking only players. 1 mean aliens attacking players and their buildables.)
g_ambush_range 10000      (how far can aliens see. For example 300 is turret range)
